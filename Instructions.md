### Code Challenge, July 20, 2020

Every month, we feature a new challenge related to the Monthly Feature’s theme. For this month’s theme  *VS Code For You*, the challenge is:

> Create your ideal day schedule in VS Code!

### Challenge Rules:

- You must incorporate the HTML elements and attributes introduced in this lesson: [HTML Tables](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/html-tables/exercises/review-html-tables).
- You must use a minimum of three (3) CSS properties introduced in this lesson: [CSS Visual Rules](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-visual-rules).
Suggestion: add 3 `color`s, a `font-family` of your choosing, and at least 2 different `font-size`s.
- You must code this in your text editor, preferably VS Code to stay on the monthly feature theme but not mandatory.
- Originality and readability of your code (make it your own and use style conventions and comments to keep things legible).

`rowspan` how many rows that particular cell should span within the table

### Choose a minimum of 3 CSS Properties:
